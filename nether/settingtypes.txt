#    If enabled, regular players which are in the nether can leave it only with
#    a nether portal and other ways of teleportation, e.g. the /spawn
#    chatcommand, are blocked. Similarly, the nether can only be entered with a
#    portal.
#    This forces the players to investigate the nether and build a portal with
#    hellish effort to go back to their home in the overworld.
#    It is recommended to disable this setting in creative mode or if damage is
#    disabled.
